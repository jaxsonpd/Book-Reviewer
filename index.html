                    The Mule on the Minaret is a spy novel set in the Middle East during the Second World War. The story centres around Noel Reid, a professor of History from Cambridge who, to get away
                    from his wife, takes a posting in Lebanon and eventually ends up working for the British secret service. The book is exceptionally well written, and each sentence flows 
                    perfectly from plot point to plot point.
                    <br><br>
                    While the story is set against the backdrop of a spy thriller, it never evolves into a James Bond-style action novel. Interactions between enemies are always described in
                    official reports, and the main characters are never in any real danger. Alec instead focuses on Noel's own inner turmoil and the British opinion of the Middle East. 
                    This allows the book to investigate the complex life of a man whom the war forgets. Much time is spent on Noel's personal life, especially on the conflict 
                    between his two identities as a soldier and a professor.
                    <br><br>
                    The book leaves the reader with a distinct sense of Melancholy. Noel never manages to salvage his relationship with his wife fully, and in attempting to do so, he drives
                    away his lover. He returns to the Middle East 16 years later and reunites with his lost friends, finding that the war had brought them a "completely new satisfying life".
                    Noel remarks to end the book: "It is not difficult to live contentedly once you have realised that there is such a thing in the world as happiness, even though you have lost it, 
                    and know that you will never get it.".
